**How to install**

Extract the .zip file to the game's installation directory. Open the config.ini and write your resolution in **width** and **height**. Optionally you can adjust the blooming if you want, I already have a good middle ground here.

**CAUTION:** To avoid being banned, launch the game via the **Steam UI**. A small launcher will appear asking if you want to play single-player or multiplayer. Select **singleplayer** and EAC will not be activated. **Remember** to delete the files or place them outside the game folder when you switch back to multiplayer.
